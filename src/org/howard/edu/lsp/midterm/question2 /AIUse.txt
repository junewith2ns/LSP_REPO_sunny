Please clarify if my github paths attached in the screenshot follow the rubric

Yes ✅ — your GitHub path structure follows the rubric correctly for the midterm setup.
Here’s how it lines up with the exam instructions shown in your screenshots:

🗂 Required Package Structure (from rubric)
Each programming problem must be uploaded under the package:
org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2
📁 Your Current File Path
src/org/howard/edu/lsp/midterm/question2/
    ├── AreaCalculator.java
    └── Main.java
✅ Verification
Requirement	Your Setup	Status
Package name exactly matches org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2	✅ Matches	✅ Correct
Files are correctly placed under that package	AreaCalculator.java & Main.java inside midterm/question2	✅ Correct
File names are appropriate (AreaCalculator for the main logic, Main for testing)	✅ Matches problem statement	✅ Correct
Will compile with correct package declaration (package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2;)	✅ Yes, assuming both files start with that line	✅ Correct
⚠️ Just Make Sure
Both files begin with this line at the very top:
package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2;
You commit and push from the root of your project (so the folder structure remains intact).
Your GitHub repo should reflect that full nested path — not a shortcut or flattened structure.
✅ Conclusion:
Your folder and file placement perfectly follow the rubric and will meet the grading requirement.
